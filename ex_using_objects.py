# Write a function use that gets an Object as first argument and a function name of type string as second argument. Your function should print out the return value of the function from the Object.
#
# Example:
#
# class Bla():
#     def foo(self):
#         return "Called foo on Bla object"
#
# use(Bla(), "foo") == "Called foo on Bla object"
#
