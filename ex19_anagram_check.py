# Write a python function called anagram_or_set which takes two strings and checks if they are an anagram (all letters occur evenly often in both strings), a set_anagram (all letters occur evenly often when considering the *set* of letters) or no_anagram. Return the corresponding value ('anagram', 'set_anagram', or 'no_anagram')
#
# Hints:
# - somelist.sort()/sorted(somelist)
# - set()
#
# You must use sorting and sets, but you are not allowed to import a library!
