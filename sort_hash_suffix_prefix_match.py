# Write a python function called funcy_sort that gets as input a file path. You have to extract all lines that either starts with aa or ends with ee, then sort its content (by line, not by character), and then calculate the md5 hash of the concatenated string (without new lines!).
#
# You must use the md5 function from the hashlib library!
