# Write a function search_destroy that gets as input a list that contains numbers, plus an optional argument that is 2 per default. For each number in the list print the number multiplied with the optional argument. However, if you encounter a 0 in the list, abort and print “Encountered Zero Value”. If the for loop over the list is finished without an encounter print “Survived Loop without seeing 0's”.
#
# Example: search_destroy([1, 2, 3, 4, 0]) prints:
#
# 2
# 4
# 6
# 8
# Encountered Zero Value
#
#
# You are not allowed to import a library and you must use a for-else loop.
